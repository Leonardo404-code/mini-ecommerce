# Mini e-commerce

This is a study project aimed at improving my skills as a full-stack developer.

- Requirements:
  - Node Js V12 or higher
  - Golang version 14 or higher
  - Docker container with postgres database or the database itself installed
  - Account on the stripe

## How Works

### Clone project

```jsx
git clone git@github.com:Leonardo404-code/mini-ecommerce.git
```

### Copy API key in stripe

- Create a free account in stripe
- Copy the api key that is in the path: Developers > API Keys

### Replace api key in project on frontend and backend

- frontend file: src/pages/Payment/index.js
- backend file: src/controllers/paymentController.go
